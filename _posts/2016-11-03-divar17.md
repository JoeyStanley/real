I'm excited to announce I've been accepted to present at the first iteration of the Diversity and Variation in Language Conference ([DiVar1](http://linguistics.emory.edu/home/conferences/divar1/index.html)), which will be held at Emory University in Atlanta February 10–11. I'm excited to hear that many of my collegues at UGA have also been accepted, so it should be a fun day for us. 

In a nutshell I'm showing that in word lists people pronounce *pull* and *pole* the same but *Mary* and *merry* different, but in a minimal pair task, *pull* and *pole* are separate while *Mary* and *merry* are the same. I spent the summer in Washington state, and I'm only looking at a little less than 3% of everything I recorded for this conference. 

I'll post a summary of the presentation and the slides once the conference is over. Stay tuned.
