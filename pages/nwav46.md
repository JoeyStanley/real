Thanks for stopping by my poster. In a nutshell, I found a couple interesting things going on in a small town in Washington:

*Linguistic changes*—I focused on two variables: <span style="font-variant: small-caps">bag</span>-raising and <span style="font-variant: small-caps">goat</span>-diphthongization. Specifically, older people raised <span style="font-variant: small-caps">bag</span> and younger people had a more diphthongal <span style="font-variant: small-caps">goat</span>. The generational divide was around 1970 and the difference between older and younger people was sudden.

*Census data*—Based on topics of conversation in the interviews, I took a look at census data and found some correlation with these linguistic changes. The mills layed a bunch of people off, people were earning less money, a bunch of people left town, and more of those who stayed worked outside the community. Correlation does not equal causation, but it's paints a pretty compelling picture. 

*Catastrophic events*—One of the interesting findings was using regression with breakpoint as a way to model catastrophic change. I'm refining this methodology right now, but it does seem to work for modeling language change in time.
